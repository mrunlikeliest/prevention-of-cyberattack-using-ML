PREVENTION OF CYBER-ATTACKS USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM
The ML field, which can be briefly defined as enabling computers to make
successful predictions using past experiences, has exhibited an impressive development
recently with the help of the rapid increase in the storage capacity and processing power of
computers. Nowadays, a large amount of data is available everywhere. Therefore, it is very
important to analyze this data in order to extract some useful information and to develop an
algo. based on this analysis. This can be achieved through data mining and ML. ML is used
to design algo based on data trends and historical relationships between data. diverse ML
methods will be successfully deployed to address such wide-ranging problems in computer
security This will discusses and highlight different applications of ML in cyber security.
